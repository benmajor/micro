# Î¼ Micro - Flat-file PHP CMS

**Micro** is blazingly-fast file-based content management system written in PHP. It is designed to be user-friendly by a wide range of audiences, so whetehr you're a content writer, a developer or a designer, Micro has got you covered! The concept was born out of my own need to create websites quickly, which not only looked good, but had a wealth of features and performed blazingly fast on the web. 

Having trialled several flat-file CMS options around, I decided to create **Micro** as something slightly different. It is a barebones system, but allows plugins and extensions to be easily created by the community. **Micro** doesn't ship with anything other than basic content management, so there is no admin panel, blog, or anything unnecessary (this functionality can be added by using Plugins, of course).
